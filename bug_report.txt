API Bug Reports and Fixes
=========================

Known Issues
------------

Link table connections not working in multi-collection requests

The attach query parameter currently doesn't support link table relationships

Model->get() parameter override not working. Busted implementation removed. Workaround is to set request parameters in constructor and just call get() without parameters. 

Fixed Bugs
----------
Join between target and related collection acts as related LEFT JOIN target in CC; should be INNER JOIN behavior
Resolved 2015/02/20 - currently uses an inner join statement for first query to related table; this may not be the most efficient route later on, but it beats going through all projects 

attach when making CIC or CC requests not working
Resolved 2015/02/20 - attaches now work as expected. Note that the localKey MUST be included in the result set or the attach fails with a Status 400
